  12345
  ```

### 4. 🔄 Binary Decreasing Triangle (`Q-4.cpp`)
A program that generates a triangle of alternating 1s and 0s with decreasing width per row.
- 🔣 Creates a pattern of binary digits (1s and 0s)
- 🔄 Alternates between 1 and 0 based on position
- 🔍 Demonstrates conditional output within nested loops
- ✨ Output Example:
  ```
  10101
   1010
    101
     10
      1
  ```

### 5. 📐 Symmetric Number Pyramid (`Q-5.cpp`)
A program that creates a symmetric pyramid pattern of numbers.
- 🔣 Uses spaces for proper alignment
- 🔢 Generates a symmetric pattern with ascending and descending numbers
- 🔍 Demonstrates complex pattern generation with multiple loops
- ✨ Output Example:
  ```
      5
     454
    34543
   2345432
  123454321
  ```

### 6. 🔄 Mirror Number Pattern (`Q-6.cpp`)
A program that creates a mirrored number pattern with numbers increasing then decreasing.
- 🔢 Prints numbers in ascending order followed by descending order
- 🔣 Uses spaces to maintain alignment
- 🔍 Demonstrates symmetric pattern printing techniques
- ✨ Output Example:
  ```
  1     1
  12   21
  123 321
  1234321
  12345321
  ```

### 7. ⭐ Custom Star Pattern (`Q-7.cpp`)
A program that prints a custom pattern using asterisks, with two different implementation approaches.
- 🌟 Uses asterisks to create a specific pattern
- 💡 Shows two different implementation approaches (conditional and ternary operator)
- 🔍 Demonstrates alternative ways to achieve the same output
- ✨ Output Example (Solution 2):
  ```
  * * * * *
  *       *
  * * * * *
  *
  *
  ```

## 🚀 How to Compile and Run
Each C++ program can be compiled and executed using a C++ compiler such as g++:

g++ -o program1 Q-1.cpp
g++ -o program2 Q-2.cpp
# ... and so on for each program

# To run
./program1
./program2
# ... and so on for each program
```
