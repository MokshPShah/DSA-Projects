# 🔄 Looper

## 📝 Overview
The Looper project contains a collection of C++ programs demonstrating fundamental loop concepts and basic algorithms. Each program illustrates different applications of loops in solving various programming problems.

## 📂 Contents

### 1. 🔤 Alphabetic Pattern Generator (`1.cpp`)
A program that generates a sequence of alphabets with a specific pattern using a do-while loop.
- ✨ Demonstrates character manipulation
- 🔄 Shows the use of do-while loops for pattern generation
- ⏭️ Increments characters by 4 positions in each iteration
- 🔡 Outputs sequence from 'a' until reaching 'z'

### 2. 🔢 Digit Counter (`2.cpp`)
A program that counts the number of digits in a user-provided integer using a while loop.
- 📥 Takes user input for a number
- 0️⃣ Handles the special case of 0 (one digit)
- 🔄 Uses a loop to count digits by successively dividing by 10
- 📊 Displays the count of digits to the user

### 3. ➕ First and Last Digit Sum (`3.cpp`)
A program that calculates the sum of the first and last digits of a two-digit or larger number.
- 📥 Takes user input for a number
- ✅ Includes input validation (positive number and at least two digits)
- 1️⃣ Extracts the first digit using division
- 9️⃣ Extracts the last digit using modulo
- ➕ Calculates and displays the sum of these digits

## 🚀 How to Compile and Run
Each C++ program can be compiled and executed using a C++ compiler such as g++:

```bash
# To compile
g++ -o program1 1.cpp
g++ -o program2 2.cpp
g++ -o program3 3.cpp

# To run
./program1
./program2
./program3
```
