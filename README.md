## 📋 Project Categories

### 🧩 Assortment
A collection of miscellaneous C++ programs demonstrating various DSA concepts and problem-solving techniques. Each file contains a standalone program focusing on a specific concept or algorithm.

### ⭕ Circlet
This folder contains programs that demonstrate pattern-based problems and solutions. The programs in this directory are particularly helpful for understanding nested loop logic and pattern generation in C++.

### 🔄 Looper
A set of programs focused on loop-based algorithms and iterations. These examples showcase various looping techniques and their applications in problem-solving.

## 🏁 Getting Started

This section provides comprehensive guidance to help you set up, understand, and utilize this DSA project repository effectively.

### 📝 Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)
- Basic understanding of C++ syntax
- IDE or text editor of your choice (Visual Studio, VSCode, etc.)
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

### 💻 Environment Setup

#### Windows
1. Install a C++ compiler:
   - **Option 1**: Install [MinGW](https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/) for GCC
   - **Option 2**: Install [Visual Studio Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) with C++ workload
   
2. Set up your IDE:
   - For VSCode:
     - Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
     - Install the C/C++ extension
     - Configure `tasks.json` for building C++ files

#### macOS
1. Install a C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   xcode-select --install  # Installs command line tools including Clang
   ```
   
2. Optional: Install an IDE like VSCode or CLion

#### Linux
1. Install GCC and build tools:
   ```bash
   # For Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install build-essential gdb
   
   # For Fedora
   sudo dnf install gcc-c++ gdb
   ```

### 📋 Project Navigation

1. **Clone the repository** (if you have Git):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MokshPShah/DSA-Projects.git
   cd DSA-Projects
   ```
   
2. **Explore the directories**:
   - Browse through `Assortment`, `Circlet`, and `Looper` folders to see available examples
   - Each `.cpp` file can be compiled and run independently

### ⚙️ Compilation and Execution

To compile and run any of the programs, navigate to the specific directory and use your preferred C++ compiler:

```bash
# Example using g++
g++ -o program_name file_name.cpp
./program_name  # On Windows: program_name.exe

# Example with C++11 standard
g++ -std=c++11 -o program_name file_name.cpp
./program_name
```

#### Using an IDE:
1. **Visual Studio**:
   - Open the .cpp file
   - Press F5 to compile and run

2. **VSCode**:
   - Open the .cpp file
   - Use the Run button or keyboard shortcut

### 🔍 Example Workflow

1. Start with a basic example from the Looper directory:
   ```bash
   cd Looper
   g++ -o loop_example 1.cpp
   ./loop_example
   ```

2. Analyze the output and code structure
3. Modify the code to experiment with different approaches
4. Recompile and run to see your changes

### 🚀 Taking It Further

1. **Implement your own solutions**: Create new .cpp files with your implementations
2. **Benchmark different approaches**: Compare the efficiency of different algorithms
3. **Extend existing examples**: Add features or optimizations to the provided code examples
